## Convert to Enterprise Edition

You can convert your GitLab Community Edition (CE) instance to a GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) instance:

- [Convert a Linux package instance to EE](package.md)
- [Convert a Docker instance to EE](docker.md)
- [Convert a self-compiled instance to EE](self_compiled.md)
- [Convert a GitLab Helm chart instance to EE](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/deployment.html#convert-community-edition-to-enterprise-edition)

If required, you can [revert from Enterprise Edition to Community Edition](revert.md).

## Convert a self-compiled instance to a Linux package

If you have a self-compiled GitLab instance, you can
[convert a self-compiled GitLab instance to Linux package](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/convert_to_omnibus/).
