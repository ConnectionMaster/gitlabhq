The AI Catalog is a central list of agents and flows.
Add these agents and flows to your project to get started orchestrating agentic AI tasks.
Agents perform tasks for you, like creating merge requests, and can answer complex questions.

Use the AI Catalog to:

- Discover agents and flows created by the GitLab team and community members.
- Create agents and flows, and share them with other users.
- Enable agents and flows in your projects to use them across the GitLab Duo Agent Platform.
