{{< /details >}}

The instructions for upgrading a Linux package instance depend on whether you have a single-node or multi-node
GitLab instance. To upgrade a multi-node Linux package GitLab instance, see:

- [Upgrade a multi-node instance with downtime](../with_downtime.md).
- [Upgrade a multi-node instance with zero downtime](../zero_downtime.md).

To upgrade a single-node Linux package GitLab instance, follow the information on this page.

If you host the product documentation, you can also
[upgrade it to a later version](../../administration/docs_self_host.md#upgrade-the-product-documentation-to-a-later-version).

## Prerequisites

Before you upgrade a single-node Linux package GitLab instance:

- You must [read required information and perform required steps](../plan_your_upgrade.md).
- If required, upgrade to a [supported operating system](../../install/package/_index.md).
- When upgrading the operating system, if your `glibc` version changes, you must follow
  [upgrading operating systems for PostgreSQL](../../administration/postgresql/upgrading_os.md) to avoid corrupted indexes.
- Ensure PostgreSQL, Redis, and Gitaly are running.

The GitLab database is backed up before installing a newer GitLab version. You can skip this automatic database backup
by creating an empty file at `/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-backup`:

```shell
sudo touch /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-backup
```

Nevertheless, you should maintain a full up-to-date [backup](../../administration/backup_restore/_index.md) on your own.

## Upgrade a single-node Linux package instance

To upgrade a single-node Linux package instance:

1. Consider [turning on maintenance mode](../../administration/maintenance_mode/_index.md) during the upgrade.
1. Pause [running CI/CD pipelines and jobs](../plan_your_upgrade.md#pause-cicd-pipelines-and-jobs).
1. [Upgrade GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/) to the same version as your target GitLab version.
1. [Upgrade GitLab with the Linux package](#upgrade-with-the-linux-package).

After you upgrade:

1. Unpause [running CI/CD pipelines and jobs](../plan_your_upgrade.md#pause-cicd-pipelines-and-jobs).
1. If enabled, [turn off maintenance mode](../../administration/maintenance_mode/_index.md#disable-maintenance-mode).
1. Run [upgrade health checks](../plan_your_upgrade.md#run-upgrade-health-checks).

## Upgrade with the Linux package

To upgrade GitLab running on a single node, or upgrade a node that is part of a multi-node GitLab instance, upgrade by
either:

- [Using the official repositories](#upgrade-with-the-official-repositories-recommended).
- [Using a downloaded package](#upgrade-with-a-downloaded-package).

### Upgrade with the official repositories (recommended)

All GitLab packages are posted to the GitLab [package server](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/).

| Repository                                                                             | Description |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| [`gitlab/gitlab-ce`](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce)                     | Stripped down package that contains only the Community Edition features. |
| [`gitlab/gitlab-ee`](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ee)                     | Full GitLab package that contains all the Community Edition and Enterprise Edition features. |
| [`gitlab/nightly-builds`](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/nightly-builds)           | Nightly builds. |
| [`gitlab/nightly-fips-builds`](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/nightly-fips-builds) | Nightly FIPS-compliant builds. |
| [`gitlab/gitlab-fips`](https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-fips)                 | FIPS-compliant builds. |

By default, Linux distribution package managers install the latest available version of a package. You can't upgrade directly to the
latest major version of GitLab if your [upgrade path](../upgrade_paths.md) requires multiple stops. If your upgrade
path includes multiple versions, you must specify the specific GitLab package version with each upgrade.

If your upgrade path has no interim steps, you can upgrade directly to the latest version.

### Upgrade with a downloaded package

If you don't want to use the official repositories, you can
download the package and install it manually. This method can be used to either
install GitLab for the first time or upgrade it.

To download and install or upgrade GitLab:

1. Go to the [official repository](#upgrade-with-the-official-repositories-recommended) of your package.
1. Filter the list by searching for the version you want to install. For example, `18.4.1`. Multiple packages might
   exist for a single version, one for each supported distribution and architecture. Because some files are
   relevant to more than one distribution, there is a label next to the filename that indicates the distribution.
1. Find the package version you wish to install, and select the filename from the list.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Download**.
1. After the package is downloaded, install it by using one of the
   following commands and replacing `<package_name>` with the package name
   you downloaded:
